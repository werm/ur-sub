Feel like a website needs a redesign? Some logo is keeping you from getting a good night's sleep? This is the place to dump your unsolicited redesigns and find peace in your mind, once again.

**UnsolicitedRedesigns needs a few more moderators. Contact [Kriem](http://www.reddit.com/user/Kriem) if you're intrerested!**

**RULES:** 
*These are not final and may change at any time!*
* Be kind
* Be constructive - You might or might not like a redesign, and you're entitled to your opinion. Just keep it constructive. ("The colors create an unreadable contrast", rather than "It looks like shit!"

*****

**GUIDLINES:** 
*These are not final and may change at any time!*
* If you post a picture of your redesign, it would be **very** helpful if you would do a *Before* and *After*, e.g. "Here's how it looks now." and "Here's my version."
* Obviously, the above guideline does not apply to reddit redesigns
* Feel free to re-redesign

**USEFUL TOOLS:**  

* **Google Chrome Extensions**
	* [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) Allows you to quickly create and apply custom CSS to websites and see changes in real time.
	* [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hc=search&hcp=main) Like Stylebot, but not as easy to use. It has a **huge** community [here](http://userstyles.org).
	* [dotjs](http://defunkt.io/dotjs/) *For OS X only!* An extension that executes JavaScript files in ~/.js based on their filename.
	* [Palette for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oolpphfmdmjbojolagcbgdemojhcnlod) Creates a color palette from any image.

* **Firefox Add-ons**
	* [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/) No explanation needed!
	* [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) Just like the Chrome extension, but for Firefox.
	* [Rainbow Color Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rainbow-color-tools/) Color picker and eyedropper + saving colors and trying out colors with drag and drop.
